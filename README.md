# teatime

This is a re-make of [bubble timer](https://github.com/bobgeis/BubbleTimer) in clojurescript (for the purpose of learning cljs).

It can be used as a simple timer.  A sound will play when a timer finishes.

* Click and drag to make timer bubbles
* Click a bubble to pause or unpause it
* Shift-click a bubble to delete it
* Press space to pause/unpause all bubbles.
* Press return to save the current bubbles to local storage (they will be restored on reload)
* Press escape to clear the local storage

TODO:
* Bubble sounds
* Bug: Gradient center moves after half time up
* Spiral counter
* Doge mode
